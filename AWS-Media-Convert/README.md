# Build a Video Converter and Video Streaming by Using AWS

**HLS** stands for **HTTP Live Streaming**, is a media streaming protocol for delivering visual and audio media to viewers over the internet.

**AWS Elemental MediaConvert** is a file-based video processing service that allows video providers with any size content library to easily and reliably transcode on-demand content for broadcast and multiscreen delivery. 

**Amazon CloudFront** is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.

## Scenario

If you are looking to encode only a couple of videos  to **HLS** playlist, you could consider converting all videos manually, but if you have a larger library, it is important to replace any manual steps with a good encoding way. **AWS Elemental MediaConvert** has all the important components you need to create a videos converting way.  

If you want to streaming your videos to global viewers, but afraid of some users may have latency to load your website or media, **Amazon CloudFront** can speed up the delivery of your static content. By using CloudFront, you can take advantage of the AWS backbone network and CloudFront edge servers to give your viewers a fast, safe, and reliable experience when they visit your website.

Also, itâ€™s important to know is the encoding working or not, so you may like to recieve a notification about the result of the work by using **Amazon CloudWatch** and **Amazon Simple Notification Service(SNS)**.

## Pre-requisites
* An AWS account.
* Make sure the region is **US East (N. Virginia)**, which its short name is **us-east-1**.
